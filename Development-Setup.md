# **Getting Started with Mobile Wallet (Mifos Pay)**

Before you begin, ensure you have already downloaded and correctly set up the Android Studio SDK. You can find a guide on how to do this here: [Setting up Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio).

## **1. Fork the Git Repository**

Forking the repository is the first step to start contributing. Click on the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner of the [Mobile Wallet (Mifos Pay) repository](https://github.com/openMF/mobile-wallet) to create your own fork.

Forking creates a copy of the project under your GitHub account. This enables you to work on changes without affecting the original repository directly.

## **2. Clone the Forked Repository**

Once you have forked the repository, you need to clone it to your local development environment. Open a terminal or Git Bash and use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourUsername/mobile-wallet.git
```

Replace **yourUsername** with your actual GitHub username. Cloning creates a local copy of the repository on your machine, allowing you to make changes and contributions.



## **3. Working Locally on Your Cloned Repository**

After cloning, navigate to the project directory using the terminal or Git Bash.

Before making any changes, create a new branch dedicated to the feature or bug fix you'll be working on:

``` bash
git checkout -b "new-branch-name"
```

Ensure that **new-branch-name** reflects the purpose of your changes (e.g., **add-payment-feature** or **fix-bug-123**).

Make the necessary changes to the files to address the issue you're working on. Once you're done, you will be ready to proceed with verifying and committing your changes.
